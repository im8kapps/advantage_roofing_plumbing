Cold snaps can undo weeks of remodel progress if plumbing lines freeze. Advise homeowners to maintain at least 55°F indoors during construction, even when walls are open. Drain exterior hose bibs and install insulated covers, then add heat tape to any supply lines running along exterior walls. When staging materials overnight, keep cabinet and vanity doors open so warm air reaches hidden pipes. Before drywall goes back up, confirm every new line is pressure tested and labeled—future service calls take minutes instead of hours. A little prep keeps winter remodels on schedule and under budget.
