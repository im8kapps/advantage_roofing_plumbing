Winter in Indiana can be tough on your home’s exterior. Freezing temperatures, snow, and ice put stress on roofs and plumbing systems. Taking time now to prepare can save you costly repairs later.

## Inspect Your Roof

* Look for missing or damaged shingles, cracked flashing, or any signs of wear.
* Check for sagging areas or leaks inside your attic.
* Replace damaged shingles and seal any gaps around chimneys or vents.

## Clean Gutters and Downspouts

* Remove leaves and debris from gutters so water can flow freely.
* Ensure downspouts direct water at least six feet away from your foundation to prevent pooling and ice dams.

## Insulate and Protect Plumbing

* Drain and shut off outdoor faucets and hoses.
* Insulate exposed pipes in unheated areas like crawl spaces or basements.
* Consider installing heat tape on pipes that are especially vulnerable to freezing.

## Schedule a Professional Inspection

A roofing and plumbing professional can identify issues you might miss and recommend preventive measures. Scheduling an inspection before temperatures drop gives you peace of mind and ensures your home is ready for winter.

By following this checklist, you’ll help protect your home from winter damage and keep your family safe and comfortable. If you need assistance with your roofing or plumbing, our team at Advantage Roofing & Plumbing is here to help.
