Hosting guests means every faucet, toilet, and water heater is on duty. Give your plumbing a 30-minute tune-up now and avoid emergency calls later.

### Check water heater settings

Keep the temperature between 120°F and 130°F. That is hot enough for sanitation but safe for little hands.

### Test sump pump and battery backup

If the alarm does not chirp when you lift the float, call us. We keep replacement pumps on the truck for same-day swaps.

### Inspect supply lines

Look under sinks and behind toilets for brittle or bulging hoses. Stainless braided lines are a low-cost upgrade that prevents major damage.

### Clean garbage disposal and traps

Run a mix of ice cubes, vinegar, and lemon to clear buildup. Follow it by a hot water flush so drains run smooth during heavy use.

> Pro tip: keep the number `317-405-7390` handy. We answer emergency plumbing calls day or night.
