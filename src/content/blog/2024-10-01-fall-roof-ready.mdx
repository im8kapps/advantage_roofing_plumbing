As temperatures drop, we recommend scheduling a roof walk-through and simple maintenance to avoid emergency calls later.

## 1. Clear gutters and downspouts

Debris piles up fast when Indiana trees begin to shed. Flush the gutters and check that downspouts are aimed away from the foundation so water does not back up under the shingles.

## 2. Inspect shingles and flashing

Look for loose tabs, hail bruises, or lifted flashing. If you are not comfortable climbing, snap photos from the ground or call our crewâ€”we include a photo report with every inspection.

## 3. Test attic ventilation

The heat trapped in an attic can warp decking and shorten shingle life. Make sure vents are open and fans are functioning before winter moisture arrives.

## 4. Trim overhanging branches

Branches swaying in fall storms can tear shingles or clog gutters overnight. A quick trim creates a safe clearance zone above the roofline.

## 5. Schedule a professional tune-up

We offer seasonal roof tune-ups that include a point-by-point inspection, minor repairs, and documentation if you need to file an insurance claim later.

> Staying proactive now keeps your home dry through the freeze-thaw cycles ahead.
