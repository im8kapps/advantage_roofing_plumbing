We recently wrapped a full exterior renovation that combined roofing, siding, gutter, and porch upgrades on a 1990s home. The owners wanted lower maintenance and a warmer welcome when guests pull up.

## Scope at a glance

- Removed failing vinyl siding and installed fiber-cement lap siding with insulated house wrap
- Upgraded gutter system with oversized downspouts and seamless gutter guards
- Built a craftsman-inspired front porch with cedar columns and tongue-and-groove ceiling
- Replaced exterior lighting and matched new color palette across shutters and doors

## Timeline and coordination

Our team handled roofing, exterior carpentry, and gutter crews under a single contract. We staged work so the family never lost access to the front entrance and finished the full scope in 12 working days.

## Energy savings

The insulated wrap and tight flashing details cut drafts immediately. The homeowners reported a noticeable change in cooling load within the first week.
