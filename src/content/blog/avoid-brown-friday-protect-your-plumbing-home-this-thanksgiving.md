To keep your plumbing running smoothly and help you prepare your home for winter, here are some practical steps you can take today.  

## What Is Brown Friday?  

The Friday after Thanksgiving sees a huge increase in plumbing service calls.  Experts from plumbing companies say that meal preparation and extra guests overwhelm kitchen sinks, garbage disposals and toilets ([How to avoid the worst of 'Brown Friday' - the busiest day of the year for plumbers](https://nypost.com/2024/11/28/lifestyle/how-to-avoid-the-worst-of-brown-friday-the-busiest-day-of-the-year-for-plumbers/#:~:text=How%20to%20avoid%20the%20worst,necessary%20to%20prevent%20further%20damage)).  Dense food items like bones, peels and fibrous vegetables, and fats or grease poured down the drain can clog disposal blades and pipes ([How to avoid the worst of 'Brown Friday' - the busiest day of the year for plumbers](https://nypost.com/2024/11/28/lifestyle/how-to-avoid-the-worst-of-brown-friday-the-busiest-day-of-the-year-for-plumbers/#:~:text=How%20to%20avoid%20the%20worst,necessary%20to%20prevent%20further%20damage)).  Bathroom drains also struggle to handle increased usage when many people shower or flush wipes and other items.  

## Kitchen Tips to Avoid Clogs  

- **Trash or compost waste:** Don’t put turkey bones, corn cobs, potato skins or onion peels down the sink.  These dense, fibrous items wrap around disposal blades and cause jams ([How to avoid the worst of 'Brown Friday' - the busiest day of the year for plumbers](https://nypost.com/2024/11/28/lifestyle/how-to-avoid-the-worst-of-brown-friday-the-busiest-day-of-the-year-for-plumbers/#:~:text=How%20to%20avoid%20the%20worst,necessary%20to%20prevent%20further%20damage)).  Compost vegetable scraps or toss them in the trash instead.  

- **Never pour grease down the drain:** Oil and fat solidify in pipes and create blockages ([How to avoid the worst of 'Brown Friday' - the busiest day of the year for plumbers](https://nypost.com/2024/11/28/lifestyle/how-to-avoid-the-worst-of-brown-friday-the-busiest-day-of-the-year-for-plumbers/#:~:text=How%20to%20avoid%20the%20worst,necessary%20to%20prevent%20further%20damage)).  Pour cooled grease into a container and dispose of it in the trash.  

- **Use strainers and empty them often:** Strainers over the sink catch food debris before it enters your pipes.  

## Bathroom Etiquette for Guests  

- **Provide wastebaskets:** Keep small waste bins in guest bathrooms so visitors don’t flush items like wipes, floss or cotton balls that can clog toilets ([How to avoid the worst of 'Brown Friday' - the busiest day of the year for plumbers](https://nypost.com/2024/11/28/lifestyle/how-to-avoid-the-worst-of-brown-friday-the-busiest-day-of-the-year-for-plumbers/#:~:text=How%20to%20avoid%20the%20worst,necessary%20to%20prevent%20further%20damage)).  

- **Space out showers:** When many people are staying overnight, ask guests to wait 10‑15 minutes between showers.  This gives drains time to clear and avoids overwhelming your sewer system ([How to avoid the worst of 'Brown Friday' - the busiest day of the year for plumbers](https://nypost.com/2024/11/28/lifestyle/how-to-avoid-the-worst-of-brown-friday-the-busiest-day-of-the-year-for-plumbers/#:~:text=How%20to%20avoid%20the%20worst,necessary%20to%20prevent%20further%20damage)).  

- **Keep a plunger handy:** A plunger in each bathroom can quickly resolve minor clogs without embarrassment ([How to avoid the worst of 'Brown Friday' - the busiest day of the year for plumbers](https://nypost.com/2024/11/28/lifestyle/how-to-avoid-the-worst-of-brown-friday-the-busiest-day-of-the-year-for-plumbers/#:~:text=How%20to%20avoid%20the%20worst,necessary%20to%20prevent%20further%20damage)).
