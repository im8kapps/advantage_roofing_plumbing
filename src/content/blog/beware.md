Roofing Inc was hired to come in and evaluate / repair a problem. A diBerent roofing
contractor had installed this white patch over the side of a roof to try and temporarily stop
water from hashtag#leaking into a home. What we found, the existing membrane was not
prepared correctly and the new roofing was not heated correctly. The result was that you
could peel the new membrane right oB the old material. The owner wasted well over a
thousand dollars because the hashtag#roofingcontractor was not qualified to do the work.
BTW - you should see the roofing contractor's social media adds where they state they are
they have over fifty years of experience. Please do your research so you don't get scammed!!
