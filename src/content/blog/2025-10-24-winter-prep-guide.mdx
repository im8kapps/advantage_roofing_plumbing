As frosty winds approach, taking time to winterize your home can save headaches when temperatures plunge. Here are some steps to safeguard your roof and plumbing before the first snow.

## Insulate exposed pipes

Pipes in unheated areas like crawl spaces or garages are vulnerable to freezing and bursting. Wrap them with foam insulation and consider heat tape for added protection. Don't forget to secure connections to prevent drafts.

## Check roof insulation and ventilation

Adequate attic insulation and airflow prevent ice dams and moisture buildup. Inspect for bare spots or compressed insulation and ensure soffit vents are clear. Balanced ventilation helps keep attic temperatures stable all winter long.

## Seal gaps and leaks around fixtures

Cold air can seep in where plumbing enters walls or where flashing meets the roof. Use silicone caulk or expanding foam to seal small gaps. This reduces heat loss and keeps critters from seeking warmth inside your home.

## Disconnect outdoor hoses and shut off spigots

Remove hoses from outdoor faucets, drain them, and store them indoors. If your spigots have a shutoff valve, close it and open the exterior tap to let water drain. This simple step prevents frozen plumbing lines outside.
