Hiring the right contractor can make or break your project. Unfortunately, not every contractor operates with integrity. Use this guide to choose wisely and protect yourself.

## Start with Research

* Ask friends and neighbors for recommendations, but do your own vetting.
* Verify that the contractor holds current licenses and insurance appropriate for your area and type of work.
* Look at online reviews and ratings on trusted platforms.

## Get Multiple Quotes and Detailed Contracts

* Obtain at least three written quotes describing the scope of work, materials, timelines, and payment schedules.
* Compare bids for price and completeness, not just bottom-line cost.
* Insist on a detailed written contract that outlines responsibilities and includes a clear payment schedule linked to milestones.

## Watch for Red Flags

* Contractors who ask for large up‑front payments or cash-only deals.
* Pressure tactics such as limited-time offers or demands to sign immediately.
* Lack of a physical business address or unwillingness to provide references.

## Check References and Past Work

* Ask for and call references to learn about past experiences with the contractor.
* View photos or visit completed projects to assess quality.
* Confirm that the contractor has experience with projects similar to yours.

Choosing a reputable contractor takes time, but it’s worth it. Doing your due diligence helps you avoid dishonest operators and ensures your project is completed professionally and on budget.
