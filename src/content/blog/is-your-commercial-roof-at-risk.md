Here are some signs that your commercial roof might not
be working as it should and could face expensive issues down the road:
- Deteriorated membrane (cracks, general wear)
- Ponding water
- Failing flashings
- Blocked drains
Taking a moment to inspect your roof this season can help catch these issues early on,
addressing them before water enters your building.
