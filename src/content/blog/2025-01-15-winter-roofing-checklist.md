Staying ahead of winter weather keeps surprise leaks off your plate. Start with a quick roof walk to spot missing shingles or damaged flashing. Clear gutters and downspouts so snowmelt can flow freely instead of damming at the eaves. Inside, peek at the attic for frost or damp insulationâ€”both signal poor ventilation that can spiral into mold or ice dams. Finish by confirming heat cables and sump pumps are ready before the next freeze. With these five checks, you stay ahead of emergency calls and protect interior finishes all season long.
